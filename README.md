# project-landing-page

This a project intended to create a mock business landing page.
The page will include learned HTML and CSS coding skills,
including the use of CSS Flexbox.

This page will be left in an intentionally 'rough state', with
it's intention primarily to practice learned skills, and NOT
showcase a refined or stylized landing page.
